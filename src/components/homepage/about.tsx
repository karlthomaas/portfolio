            I've been really passionate about programming since beginning of High school.
            <br />
            <br />
            My Journey started with creating Discord bots for fun. Then I put my skills in use and started freelancing bots and automations
            for small bussinesses and communities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently I am freelancing full-stack web development and studying in Kood/JÃµhvi!
